# My Repo

This repo is crafted with love for the GWG18 - Missour Meetups
group!

This is repo was created as an example for the presentation,
_git & GitHub: A Gentle Introduction_ 
made to the Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship group -
Missouri Meetups.

This presentation briefly discusses what git and GitHub are,
the benefits they provide to the Web Developer, and the
use case for Personal Codebase Management. 

Enjoy!
